  If you have chosen dark colors of glaze or cream, be prepared that they can leave marks and stain the tongue. We use quality food coloring, but they are still coloring!
  Some décor (balls, pasta), so as not to fall during transportation, can be attached to toothpicks, be careful when cutting and before giving to children!
